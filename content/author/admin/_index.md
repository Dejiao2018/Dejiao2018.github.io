I'm an applied scientist at Amazon Web Services (AWS).

I received my Ph.D. degree in the <a href="https://eecs.engin.umich.edu">Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</a> department from the <a href="https://umich.edu">University of Michigan</a> in 2019, under the supervision of <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/">Prof. Laura Balzano</a>. 

<!-- I am a PhD candidate in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 
My Advisor is <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/">Prof. Laura Balzano</a>. My research mainly focuses on deep generative models, information theory in neural networks, neural network compression, subspace learning, compressed sensing, and non-convex optimization.  -->
