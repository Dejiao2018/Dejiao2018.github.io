abstract = "This work investigates the problem of adaptive measurement design for online subspace estimation from compressive linear measurements. We study the previously proposed Grassmannian rank-one online subspace estimation (GROUSE) algorithm with adaptively designed compressive measurements. We propose an adaptive measurement scheme that biases the measurement vectors towards the current subspace estimate and prove a global convergence result for the resulting algorithm. Our experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive measurement scheme over non-adaptive compressive random measurements."
# abstract_short = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."
