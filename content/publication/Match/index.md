abstract = "We consider the problem of detecting whether a high dimensional signal lies in a given low dimensional subspace using only a few compressive measurements of it. By leveraging modern random matrix theory, we show that, even when we are short on information, a reliable detector can be constructed via a properly defined measure of energy of the signal outside the subspace."
# abstract_short = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."
